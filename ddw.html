        <h1>Dutch Design Week â€” Branding & visual identity microsite </h1>
        <p>
            In this second-year information design class, we worked on a 5-week project to create a captivating microsite for Dutch Design Week, an annual design conference. Our main objective was to develop an expressive microsite that effectively showcased the event. The first three weeks involved extensive visual experimentation, exploring different design qualities and aesthetics. In the following two weeks, we focused on developing interactions and prototyping for the web. This phase included transforming our visual concepts into functional elements to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.
